Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

A1: I dont have alot of questions, I just need to practice more.

Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

A2: It took me about 5 hours to complete, I thought it will only take about a couple of hours. However, I have learned alot through this task, and I still need alot of improvements on the loop and arrays and how to logically connect them together and benefit from them, as most of my codes are done without them.

## Questions Part: ##

Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

A1: I understood the main principle of DOM tree but I have issues dealing with it as it gets confusing to apply the logic straightly from JS.

Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

A2: It took me about 1 day to complete, I thought it will only take 5-6 hours and I'm not satisfied with the result as it lacks alot of styling and the output is not professional as it needed to be, maybe the requirements are done but not in a effecient way to progress with it further.
