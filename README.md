## Questions Part: ##

Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

A1: I dont have alot of questions, I just need to practice more.

Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

A2: It took me about 5 hours to complete, I thought it will only take about a couple of hours. However, I have learned alot through this task, and I still need alot of improvements on the loop and arrays and how to logically connect them together and benefit from them, as most of my codes are done without them.
